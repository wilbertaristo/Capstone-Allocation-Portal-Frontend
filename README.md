Please create your OWN branch when working and DO NOT WORK DIRECTLY ON THE master or develop BRANCH!

After developing in your branch, merge it with develop first to make sure everything is working fine. If yes, then merge to master.

Branch Naming Rules:
1. TSK-XXX (for TASKS e.g. TSK-LoginPage to indicate implementation of login page)
2. BUG-XXX (for debugging/hotfixes e.g. BUG-LoginPageValidation to indicate fixing of bugs in login page pertaining to validation)
